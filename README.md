CHURN MODELLING:-
Bank churn modeling refers to the process of predicting whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) the bank, typically to move to another bank or institution. This predictive modeling is crucial for banks and financial institutions to understand customer behavior, reduce customer attrition rates, and improve customer retention strategies. Here are the key aspects involved in bank churn modeling:

Data Collection: The process starts with gathering relevant data about customers, which can include demographic information (age, gender, income), banking behavior , customer interactions , and external factors .

Feature Engineering: This step involves selecting and transforming the collected data into features that are useful for predicting churn. It may include creating new variables, scaling numerical data, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values. 

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms can be used for churn prediction, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. The choice of model depends on the complexity of the data and the interpretability required.

Model Training: The selected model is trained on historical data where the churn outcome (whether a customer churned or not) is known. The model learns patterns and relationships between features and the churn outcome during this phase.

Model Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model should be tested on a separate dataset (validation set or test set) to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Bank churn modeling is a dynamic field where advanced analytics techniques are continually evolving to improve prediction accuracy and enhance customer retention efforts. It combines data science with domain knowledge of banking to address a critical business challenge faced by financial institutions.
